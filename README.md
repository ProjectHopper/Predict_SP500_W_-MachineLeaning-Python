# Project Overview

In this project, we'll predict the price of the S&P500 stock market index.
</br>
We'll develp a backtesting system and use a robust error metric so we can tell if the algorithm is performing well.


**Project Steps**

* Download data using the yfinance package
* Cleaning and visualizing stock market data
* Setting up target for machine learning
* Training an initial machine learning model
* Building a backtesting system
* Adding additional predictors to model
* Improving model



## Code

File overview:
*'Predict The Stock Market w ML and Python'- a Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code to predict S&P500 prices.
